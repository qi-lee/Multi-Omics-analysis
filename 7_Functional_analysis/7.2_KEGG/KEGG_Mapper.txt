KEGG Mapper

KEGG Mapper is a collection of tools for KEGG mapping: KEGG pathway mapping, BRITE mapping, and MODULE mapping. Two pathway mapping tools, "Search Pathway" and "Color Pathway", were made available from the beginning of the KEGG project. The naming of these tools was somewhat misleading since both involved searching and coloring procedures. The latter is now called "Search&Color Pathway" and a new "Color Pathway" is introduced for coloring of a selected pathway map (without searching).
